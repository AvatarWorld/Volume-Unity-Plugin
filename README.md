A Unity3D plugin for rendering [Volume](https://volume.gl) assets. [Volume](https://volume.gl) is a machine learning driven tool, for reconstructing 2D images and videos in 3D space. For early acsses to the beta email us at [this email](#support)

## Usage

Use [this link](https://github.com/Volume-GL/Volume-Unity-Plugin/releases) to download the latest release of the plugin as a ```.unitypackage```

Once unpacked you will have a folder structure organized in the following order:
- Volume
  - Addons
  - Perfabs
  - Scenes
  - Materials
  - Shaders
  - Sample

Use the example scene found in ```Scenes/``` or just add the ```Volume Image``` prefab to your pre-existing scene.

To load assets exported from the Make interface, import them to Unity and change the ```Volume Texture``` field in the ```Volume Image``` GameObject to reflect your image.
